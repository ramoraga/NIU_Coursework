1.2 	The result of running the SELECT statement displays "Empty Set". This is because
	the transaction had not been committed and so nothing was changed in the database.

1.5	 pK | data	The result of the SELECT statement is the table and the data
	-----------	that was just inserted.
	  1 | dataA
	  2 | dataB
	  3 | dataC
	  4 | dataD
	  5 | dataE

2.4	The result of the SELECT statement displays an ERROR because table Spring hasn't
	been created and doesn't exist.

2.5	The result of the SELECT statement is the same table from before from question 1.5.
	That's because since the ROLLBACK statement was called, the database went back to
	how it was before the START TRANSACTION statement was called, sort of like a 
	backup.

3.	What happened was the program wouldn't respond and an ERROR was displayed. This is
	because a dealock occured because there was an attempt to change the same value.
